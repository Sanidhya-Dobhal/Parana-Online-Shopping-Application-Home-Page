<h1> üõí  Parana: An Online shopping website UI
<br> 
<img src = "./Images/Logos/jQuery.png" style = "height:25px; margin-top:20px"/></h1>

## üñºÔ∏è Layout Overview

1. **Header**

- Responsive navigation bar with links: Home | Products | Categories | Contact
- Search input + Go button to filter products by name

2. **Main Content**

- **Featured Products**: Three handpicked items (image, name, price, ‚ÄúGo to item‚Äù button)
- **Categories**: Grid of five categories: Electronics| Fashion| Kitchen| Home| Sports

- **Product Listings:** A dynamic product listing section where products are loaded asynchronously using **jQuery's AJAX** from a JSON file. Each product card include:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Price
  - "Add to Cart" button

3. **Shopping Cart**: A side panel that displays the items in the user's shopping cart. The cart shows

   - Product names
   - Quantities
   - Total price

4. **Footer**: Contact information and links
5. **Product details page**: A separate page displays a detailed description when more details button for a product is clicked.

## Features

1. **Element width aware resposiveness**:

- Beyond simple CSS media queries: the main content area resizes based on whether the cart sidebar is visible
- Also ensures layout never overflow viewport

2. **Persistent Cart Storage**:

- Items added to the cart are stored in `localStorage` to persist across multiple sessions

3. **Searching**:

- Users search for an item in the header search bar ‚Üí click **Go**
- If product match (case-insensitive) matching product card appear
- If no products match, a ‚ÄúNo results‚Äù lottie + text is displayed

4. **Interactive and Intuitive UI with Thoughtful Details**:

- Smooth hover effects on header navigation elements enhance user experience

- Context-aware product cards: display an ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button for new items, switch to a number input for items already in the cart, and revert back to the button if the quantity reaches 0.

- This level of detail has been maintained throughout the application.
